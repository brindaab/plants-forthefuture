  <h1 id="topic"> What are your plans for the future? </h1>
 <p> We as humans love to plan, especially to avoid any unfavourable circumstances due to not planning ahead. </p>
 <p> However, this time, more than anything, has taught us that taking effective measures for prevention of these unfavourable circumstances is far more beneficial than planning.</p>
 <p> This is where <strong>Plan(t)s for the Future</strong> comes in. </p>

 <h2 id="topic"> We provide, you nurture. </h2>
 <p> We will provide you with seeds and soil and hope to hear from you about the growth of your new sapling! </p>

 <h2 id="topic"> But, why? </h2>
 <p> Climate change, which may not be as percepible everyday, is impacting the earth in dangerous ways and one of the ways in which we can help the earth is plant as many saplings as we can to help restore the natural forest cover of the earth. <br>
 <p> If we want to take care of ourselves, we must first take care of the earth that has sustained us for so long. </p>


 <p id="fact"> <span class="ye"> DID YOU KNOW? </span> <br>
