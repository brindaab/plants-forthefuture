<ol id="fact">
  <li> <strong>Plants for the future!!</strong> : We provide seeds and soil to those who wish to grow a sapling of their own but are unable to make the arrangements to start. Anyone could do so by filling out a form of interest. We love to see growth and change and so all those tending to their plants form a plant community and send weekly updates on themselves and their plants! This is completely free of cost and a great way to form relationships and alliances with fellow ciizens of the world! </li>

  <li> <strong>The Bi-Annual Plantgram!</strong>: This is a Bi-Annual Plantgram wherein 100% of the proceeds go to local nurseries and the plants adopted from them are planted in a reserve with the goal of reaching 10000 plants this year, to help lower the carbon dioxide levels in the air and to purify the air for residents. </li>
